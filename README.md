# KYC Case Bottleneck Resolver

A B2B KYC workflow prototype for enterprise compliance teams that simulates document evidence review, beneficial ownership completeness checks, screening triage, customer risk profiling, case bottleneck diagnosis, reason-code driven follow-up actions, analyst review notes, and audit-ready decision trails.

## Core Product Question

**Why is this KYC case blocked, and what should happen next?**

## Problem Statement

Modern KYC reviews are delayed by missing evidence, incomplete beneficial ownership information, weak evidence quality, screening items requiring review, unclear ownership of follow-up actions, inconsistent analyst notes, and lack of audit-friendly rationale.

This project simulates a 2026-style KYC case workstation that helps identify case blockers, explain risk drivers, recommend the next review path, and create consistent analyst documentation.

The current prototype uses a single-page multi-view interface to simulate how a production KYC platform could separate case overview, evidence review, risk assessment, action tracking, and audit governance.

## Important Disclaimer

This is an educational portfolio project. It does not perform real sanctions screening, OFAC checks, adverse media searches, identity verification, customer verification, transaction monitoring, or bank decisioning.

This tool supports analyst workflow simulation. Final review, escalation, approval, and customer decisioning require human compliance review.

The current implementation is a static single-page workflow prototype, not production software. It simulates case intake, evidence review, risk assessment, action tracking, and governance outputs without storing or transmitting customer data.

## Target Customer

This prototype is designed as a B2B KYC workflow concept for enterprise compliance teams, including banks, fintech companies, payment companies, MSBs, and compliance operations teams that review business customers, legal entities, and higher-risk onboarding cases.

It is not designed for individual consumers. The primary users are KYC analysts, AML analysts, compliance reviewers, relationship managers, QA reviewers, and KYC operations managers.

Individual remains a supported entity type in the demo because enterprise compliance teams may review sole proprietors, control persons, or individual-linked cases as part of broader KYC operations.

## Case Data Quality Check

Before generating a case review, the tool performs an educational input-quality review:

- **Blocking issues** prevent generation when required case setup fields are missing, dates are invalid, or the target completion date is earlier than the received date.
- **Non-blocking warnings** flag potentially inconsistent BO, SOF/SOW, screening, and SLA inputs while still allowing the analyst to generate the review.
- **Inline field errors** identify required fields that need correction after a generation attempt.
- **Stale result warnings** appear when material case inputs change after a review has been generated. Recipient Type and Tone remain independently reactive and do not require full regeneration.
- **Audit-friendly output** carries non-blocking data-quality warnings into the Analyst Review Note, Audit Trail, and Triggered Rules.

These checks are illustrative workflow controls, not validation against a bank policy, authoritative customer record, screening system, or external data source.

## Workflow

1. Start in **Overview** to load a sample case or generate/reset a review.
2. Use **Case Input** to complete case setup, evidence, ownership, SOF/SOW, screening, and risk fields. The Case Input view separates demo shortcuts, core case details, review setup, optional risk context, document evidence, beneficial ownership, and SOF/SOW review so the workflow is easier to scan.
3. Generate the review to move automatically into **Results**, where executive summary, diagnostic details, bottlenecks, reason codes, and queue priority are displayed.
4. Continue to **Actions** to review the follow-up action tracker and copy a role-specific communication draft.
5. Continue to **Governance** to review analyst notes, reviewer checklist, audit trail, triggered rules, and the collapsed full rule library.

Switching tabs does not clear form data or generated outputs because the project remains a single HTML page with JavaScript-controlled views.

## Document Evidence Review

Required documents are based on entity type:

| Entity Type | Required Documents |
| --- | --- |
| Private Company | Certificate of Incorporation, Business Registration, Ownership Chart, Beneficial Owner ID, W-9 or W-8, Address Proof, Source of Funds Explanation |
| Public Company | Annual Report or 10-K, Stock Exchange Listing Evidence, Authorized Signer Information, W-9 or W-8 |
| Individual | Government ID, Address Proof, Source of Funds Explanation |
| Non-profit | Registration Certificate, Mission Statement or Website, Authorized Signer Information, Source of Funds Explanation |
| Financial Institution | Banking License or Regulatory Registration, AML Policy Summary, Wolfsberg Questionnaire, Authorized Signer Information |

The tool treats these statuses as evidence issues:

- Not Received
- Received - Expired
- Received - Incomplete
- Received - Inconsistent

Evidence issues appear in Diagnostic Details, Bottleneck Diagnosis, Follow-Up Actions, Analyst Review Note, Reviewer Checklist, and Audit Trail.

## Customer Risk Profile

The Customer Risk Profile uses Low, Medium, High, and Critical labels across:

- Customer Type Risk
- Geography Risk
- Industry Risk
- Ownership Risk
- Product / Service Risk
- Expected Activity Risk
- Screening Risk
- Documentation Risk
- Overall Customer Risk Profile

Each profile component includes a short explanation of which input drove the result.

## Risk Scoring Methodology

The score is rule-based, educational, and capped at 100.

| Risk Factor | Points |
| --- | --- |
| PEP involvement | +25 |
| Sanctions or watchlist concern | +40 |
| Adverse media | +20 |
| High-risk country | +20 |
| Complex ownership structure | +15 |
| BO incomplete | +15 |
| Missing key documents | +10 |
| High expected activity | +10 |
| Higher-risk product/service | +10 |
| Moderate product/service risk | +5 |
| Financial institution customer | +10 |
| Case overdue | +5 |
| Evidence quality issue | +10 |
| Missing Source of Funds | +10 |
| Missing Source of Wealth for higher-risk customer | +10 |
| Weak SOF/SOW explanation | +5 |

Risk levels:

| Score | Risk Level |
| --- | --- |
| 0-24 | Low |
| 25-49 | Medium |
| 50-74 | High |
| 75-100 | Critical |

Rule weights are illustrative and are not calibrated to any bank policy.

## Reason Codes

Reason codes make bottlenecks easier to scan, explain, and audit.

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DOC-001` | Missing required document |
| `DOC-002` | Evidence quality issue |
| `BO-001` | Beneficial ownership incomplete |
| `BO-002` | Complex ownership escalation |
| `SOF-001` | Source of funds issue |
| `SOW-001` | Source of wealth issue |
| `SCR-001` | Screening clearance needed |
| `SCR-002` | Potential true match |
| `ADV-001` | Adverse media review needed |
| `SLA-001` | Case aging risk |
| `RISK-001` | High or critical risk |
| `DEC-001` | Do not proceed until cleared |
| `CONF-001` | Insufficient information |

Reason codes appear in Bottleneck Diagnosis, Follow-Up Actions, Analyst Review Note, Audit Trail, and Triggered Rules.

## Suggested Review Path

The Suggested Review Path is an educational routing recommendation:

- **Standard Review:** Low or Medium risk with no material blockers.
- **Enhanced Review:** High risk, adverse media, complex ownership, or material evidence gaps.
- **Compliance Escalation:** Critical risk, potential true match, or BO escalation.
- **Do Not Proceed Until Cleared:** Sanctions/watchlist concern.

Educational recommendation only. Final decision requires human compliance review.

## Decision Confidence

Decision Confidence / Data Quality indicates whether the simulated case file is strong enough to support a review note:

- **High:** clean low-risk case with acceptable evidence.
- **Medium:** minor gaps or follow-up items remain.
- **Low:** many missing documents, BO gaps, incomplete screening identifiers, or inconsistent evidence.
- **Insufficient Information:** sanctions/watchlist concern or information gaps prevent decisioning.

If information is insufficient, the tool states that the decision cannot be finalized due to insufficient customer information.

## Explainability Center

The Explainability Center first shows **Triggered Rules for This Case**, meaning only the rules activated by the current inputs. The **Full Rule Library** is collapsed by default and organized into:

- Document Rules
- Evidence Quality Rules
- Beneficial Ownership Rules
- SOF/SOW Rules
- Screening Triage Rules
- Trigger Event Rules
- Risk Scoring Rules
- Case Readiness Rules
- Review Path Rules
- Queue Urgency Rules

## Limitations

- No real OFAC screening
- No sanctions database connection
- No adverse media search
- No identity verification
- No transaction monitoring
- No customer verification
- No bank decisioning
- No backend or database
- No login or role-based approval
- No real customer data storage
- No production policy calibration
- Rule weights are illustrative and not calibrated to any bank policy

## Future Roadmap

- Case queue import
- CSV upload
- Configurable policy rule engine
- Reviewer approval workflow
- Role-based access control
- Database persistence
- Append-only audit log
- Export to PDF or Word case memo
- Vendor screening API integration
- Document management integration
- Manager dashboard

## Future Architecture

A production version could include the following architecture. The current project does **not** include these production integrations.

- **Frontend:** a production-grade web application interface
- **Backend API:** secure service layer for workflow orchestration and policy execution
- **Database:** durable case, customer, action, and review persistence
- **Authentication:** enterprise identity and session management
- **Role-based access control:** permissions for Analysts, Reviewers, Compliance Officers, QA, and Managers
- **Core tables:** cases, customers, documents, beneficial_owners, screening_hits, risk_assessments, follow_up_actions, audit_events, users, review_approvals
- **Rule Engine:** configurable JSON-based policy rules
- **Model and rule governance:** versioning, approvals, testing evidence, and change controls for scoring and routing logic
- **Immutable audit log:** append-only event history for case and policy decisions
- **Document storage:** controlled evidence repository with retention and access policies
- **Reviewer approval workflow:** maker-checker submission, review, disposition, and approval states
- **Vendor integrations:** screening, adverse media, identity, document, and case-management providers
